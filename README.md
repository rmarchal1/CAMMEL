#Description
The CAlculated-Molecular Multipolar ELectrostatics (CAMMEL) software is an open-source graphical post-treatment software, interfaced with Molcas and OpenMolcas. Various features are implementedin this software such as :

— Wave function decomposition

— Representation of the magnetization curve

— Representation of the Ab initio Transition barriers

— Representation of the susceptibility curve

— Computation and representation of the electrostatic potential surrounding lanthanide atoms
This Software have been developed in the Institut des Sciences Chimiques de Rennes (ISCR UMR CNRS 6226, University of Rennes1) by Rémi Marchal (Computer engineer), Boris Le Guennic (CNRS Research Director), Guglielmo Fernandez-Garcia (PhD) and Vincent Montigaud (PhD).
